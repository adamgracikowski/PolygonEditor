Creating a New Polygon:
- Right-click on an empty area of the window and select "Create polygon".
- Place subsequent vertices on the screen by clicking with the left mouse button.
- To finish creating the polygon, select the starting vertex.
- To remove a partially created polygon, press the Escape key.

Deleting a Polygon:
- Right-click and select "Delete polygon".

Moving a Polygon:
- Hold down the left mouse button to move the polygon.

Vertex Management:
- Right-click while hovering over a vertex and select the desired option from the context menu.
- "Delete vertex" allows you to remove a vertex and its adjacent edges.
- "Constraints" lets you select a constraint applied to the vertex (continuity of the Bezier segment with a line segment).
- To move a vertex, hold down the left mouse button over the vertex.

Edge Management:
- Right-click while hovering over an edge and select the desired option from the context menu.
- "Add vertex" adds a new vertex at the middle of the edge.
- "Bezier" toggles the edge to a Bezier segment.
- "Constraints" allows you to select a constraint applied to the edge.
- The constraint will be activated when you move the vertex.

Bezier Segment Management:
- Right-click on the control point to revert the edge back to a straight segment.
- To move the control point, hold down the left mouse button.
